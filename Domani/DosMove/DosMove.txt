History
-------
07/08/98 ver 1.00 - Initial release.

28/08/98 ver 1.01 - Added 'EditNoBeep' property which disables the annoying
                    beep when ENTER is pressed in edit box.

09/10/98 ver 1.02 - 'EditNoBeep' fixed so that when this option is actived
                    the user can still change the text in the edit box.

Limitations
-----------
DosMove will work fine until...
since it uses the creation flow of components in a form it will work
until you set your own OnKeyPress or OnKeyDown in form with KeyPreview set
to TRUE.
however you can beat this problem by calling the inherited event before your
code runs (which in most cases isn't so good !).
