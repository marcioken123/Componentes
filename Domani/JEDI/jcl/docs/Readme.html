<h1>Jedi Code Library</h1>
<p>Release 1.97<br>
Build 2172<br>
10-February-2006</p>
<hr><br>
<h3>News</h3>
<p>JCL release 1.97 provide an updated support for all targets (including Borland 
Developer Studio 2006) and an installation of some experts in C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8.</p>
<p>As always, multiple bugs have been fixed; for detailed change logs, 
use the facilities of our CVS repository at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jcl/">SourceForge.net</a>
, see below.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Important:</span>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Note that the package naming has changed: the same package name is used by 
all versions of the compiler supporting suffixes (C++Builder 6, Delphi 6, 
Delphi 7, C#Builder 1, Delphi 8, Delphi 2005 and BDS 2006); a different suffix 
is added for each target. The installer tries to remove old packages. 
3rd party packages requiring old DJcl* resp. CJcl* packages need to be changed 
to accomodate the new naming scheme or they will cause conflicts in the IDE at load time.
</p></li>
  <li><p>DCP files are now created in the lib\target subdirectory of the JCL 
installation. 3rd party packages requiring JCL packages need to have this path 
in their "browse path" option to compile.
</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">(Windows only)&nbsp;Installation&nbsp;options:</span></p>
<p>Packages compiled by the JCL installer don't contain any debug 
informations to keep their size as small as possible.</p>
<p>The Jedi Code Library packages are required by some 3rd party packages 
(including the Jedi Visual Component Library - JVCL), the installer generates 
them if the "Packages" node is checked.</p>
<p>The installer can generate MAP informations for each package. These informations 
can be linked into binaries to become JCL debug data. Once linked MAP files could 
be deleted. These options are subnodes of the "Packages" node.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Experts:</span></p>
<p>For Delphi 5, Delphi 6, Delphi 7, C++Builder 5 and C++Builder 6, experts can 
be installed as design time packages or dll experts. For C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8, 
experts are installed as dll experts (those products don't load design time 
packages). For Delphi 2005 and Borland Developer Studio 2006, experts are 
installed as design time packages.</p>
<p>A new expert integrating version control systems in the IDE was added. 
It provides an integration of TortoiseCVS and TortoiseSVN inside the IDE, items 
are added in the IDE menu and buttons can be placed in IDE toolbars via the 
customize dialog, see below.</p>
<p>A dialog-box provides configuration options for JCL experts in the Tools menu.</p>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">.net Framework support:</span></p>
<p>A subset of JCL units was worked over to support Delphi.Net (Delphi 2005 
&amp; BDS 2006). The packages belong to the Jedi.Jcl namespace.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Supported Tools</h3>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Run time support:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Kylix 3</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Design&nbsp;time support (only experts):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>C#Builder 1 (refer to&nbsp;installation notes below).
</li>
  <li>Delphi 8.net (refer to installation notes below).</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Both supports (run time and design time):</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>Delphi version 5, 6, 7
</li>
  <li>C++Builder version 5 &amp; 6
</li>
  <li>Delphi 2005 (Delphi Win32 and Delphi.net personalities)
</li>
  <li>Borland Developer Studio 2006 (Delphi Win32, C++ Builder Win32, Delphi.net and C#Builder personalities)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not every unit supports all tools. Look out for <tt>*.exc</tt>
files in the tool-specific <tt>lib/</tt>subdirectories for a list of units 
excluded from compilation.
</li>
  <li>Kylix 3/C++ installation is broken; the installer will fail when 
it attempts to build the packages. Since the dreaded file open/save dialog Kylix 
bug is haunting us again (wasn't it considered to be defeated as of Kernel 2.4.21?), 
we are at present not investigating this further.
</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.freepascal.org/"><b>Free Pascal</b></a>&nbsp;(FP) 
support has not been updated for this release; most units from 
source/common should work with FP 2.0, as tests with a 2.0 beta (1.9.8) 
indicated, but this has not been verified. Note that there are no plans 
to&nbsp;support FP versions from the 1.0 branch.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Installation on C#Builder 1 and Delphi 8:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>These products cannot be used to build the JCL installer, you need an
    other supported product to install JCL experts on these products.</li>
  <li>These products are not able to use the JCL library as a runtime library.
   You cannot write managed applications and managed packages based on the JCL.
</li>
  <li>These products are not shipped with their native compilers, you have to
    download it from codecentral (<a href="http://cc.borland.com/">http://cc.borland.com</a>).
    The item (<a href="http://codecentral.borland.com/Download.aspx?id=21333">21333</a>)
  &nbsp;the native compiler to be installed in Delphi 8.
    The item (<a href="http://codecentral.borland.com/Download.aspx?id=21334">21334</a>)
  &nbsp;the native compiler to be installed in C#Builder 1.
    These zip files have to be extracted in the products director using the standard pattern:</li>
</ol>
<pre>		   Executable files (exe and dll)      - BDS\X.0\bin
		   Compiler files (dcp and dcu)        - BDS\X.0\lib
		   Toolsapi source files               - BDS\X.0\source\ToolsAPI.

<h3>Debug Extension for JclDebug unit</h3>
<p>The <tt>experts\debug </tt>folder contains an IDE expert which 
assists to insert JCL Debug information into executable files. This can be 
useful when use source location routines from JclDebug unit. These routines 
need some kind of special information to be able provide source location for 
given address in the process. Currently there are four options to get it work:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Generate and deploy MAP file with your executable file. The file 
is generated by the linker. It needs to be set in Project|Options 
dialog -&gt; Linker page, Detailed checkbox.
</li>
  <li>Generate and deploy JDBG file file with your executable file. 
This is binary file based on MAP file but its size is typically about 
12% of original MAP file. You can generate it by MapToJdbg tool in <tt>jcl\examples\windows\tools</tt>
folder. The advantage over MAP file is smaller size and better security 
of the file content because it is not a plain text file and it also 
contains a checksum.
</li>
  <li>Generate Borland TD32 debug symbols. These symbols are stored 
directly in the executable file but usually adds several megabytes so 
the file is very large. The advantage is you don't have to deploy any 
other file and it is easy to generate it by checking Include TD32 debug 
info in Linker option page.
</li>
  <li>Insert JCL Debug info into executable file by the IDE expert. The 
size of added data is similar to JDBG file but it will be inserted 
directly into the executable file. This is probably best option because 
it combines small size of included data and no requirement of deploying 
additional files. In case you use this option you need install the 
JclDebugIde expert.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The IDE expert will add new item to IDE Project menu. For 
Delphi 5, 6 and 7 it adds 'Insert JCL Debug data' check item at the end 
of the Project menu. When the item is checked, everytime the project is 
compiled by one of following commands: Compile, Build, Compile All Projects, Build All 
Projects or Run necessary JCL debug data are automatically inserted into the 
executable. Moreover, for Build and Build All commands dialog with detailed 
information of size of these data will be displayed.</p>
<p>
You can generate those debug data for packages and libraries as well 
using the expert. Each executable file in the project can use different option 
from those listed above. It is not necessary to generate any debug data for 
Borland runtime packages because the source location code can use names of exported 
functions to get procedure or method name. To get line number information for 
Borland RTL and VCL/CLX units you have to check Use Debug DCUs checkbox in 
Project|Options dialog -&gt; Compiler tab. Unfortunately it is not 
possible to get line number information for Borland runtime packages 
because Borland does not provide detailed MAP files for them so you get 
procedure or method name only.</p>
<p>In case you have more than one data source for an executable file by 
an accident the best one is chosen in following order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>JCL Debug data in the executable file
</li>
  <li>JDBG file
</li>
  <li>Borland TD32 symbols
</li>
  <li>MAP file
</li>
  <li>Library or Borland package exports</li>
</ol>
<p>It is also possible to insert JCL debug data programmatically to the 
executable file by using MakeJclDbg command line tool in 
jcl\examples\windows\delphitools folder. You can study included makefiles 
which uses this tool for building delphitools examples.</p>
<p>To help using JclDebug exceptional stack tracking in application 
simple dialog is provided in <tt>jcl\experts\debug\dialog</tt>folder. The dialog 
replaces standard dialog displayed by VCL or CLX application when an unhandled 
exception occurs. It has additional Detailed button showing the stack, list of 
loaded modules and other system information. By adding the dialog to the 
application exceptional stack tracking code is automatically initialized so you 
don't have to care about it. You can also turn on logging to text file by setting 
the Tag property of the dialog to '1'. There is also version for CLX 
(ClxExceptDlg) but it works on Windows only. These dialogs are intended to be added to 
Object Repository.</p>
<p><b>Short description of getting the JclDebug functionality in your 
project:</b></p>
<ol>
  <li>Close all running instances of Delphi
</li>
  <li>Install JCL and IDE experts by the JCL Installer
</li>
  <li>Run Delphi IDE and open your project
</li>
  <li>Remove any TApplication.OnException handlers from your project(if any).
</li>
  <li>Add new Exception Dialog by selecting File | New | Other ... | 
Dialogs tab, Select 'Exception Dialog' or 'Exception Dialog with Send' 
icon, Click OK button, Save the form (use ExceptionDialog.pas name, for 
example)
</li>
  <li>Check Project | Insert JCL Debug data menu item
</li>
  <li>Do Project | Build</li>
</ol>

<h3>Version control expert</h3>
<p>The JCL team is proud to release a new expert integrating version control actions 
inside the Delphi/BCB/BDS IDE. It wraps <a href="http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseCVS</a>&nbsp; 
and&nbsp;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>&nbsp;commands in 
actions that can be placed on IDE toolbars and in IDE menu.</p>
<p>This expert requires <a href="http://tortoisecvs.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseCVS</a>&nbsp; 
or/and&nbsp;<a href="http://tortoisesvn.sourceforge.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>&nbsp;installed on the 
system to work properly. Please refer to these products documentations for help 
about using version control systems.</p>
<p>The structure of the "Jcl Version" menu can be customized in the JCL options 
dialog (in the "Tools" menu).</p>
<hr>
<h3>Downloads of stable sources</h3>
<p>These sources are official JCL releases and file status can be considered as 
stable for use in final applications. During the past years, there have been around 2 
or 3 releases per year.</p>

</p>
<hr>
<h3>Development sources</h3>
<p>These files are under active development and may cause some incompatibilities 
and some conflicts with existing code. You should not use these files in final 
applications. The JCL development team provides these files for testing and 
feedback from users.</p>

      <body>
<p>You can download snapshots of the CVS repository updated every day in the 
&nbsp;<a href="http://jcl.sourceforge.net/daily">JCL daily page</a>
</p>
      </body>
    </html>
<p>To always have access to the most recent changes in the JCL, you 
should install a CVS client (we recommend TortoiseCVS and WinCVS) and download 
the CVS repository files to your computer. With the CVS client, you can update 
your local repository at any time. For more instructions on how to set up CVS 
and use it with JCL, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/docs/E04/">CVS instruction page</a>. 
You can also access the CVS repository via the&nbsp;<a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/jcl/">web interface</a>.

<h3>Getting involved in JCL development</h3>
If you want to help out making JCL better or bigger or just plain 
cooler, there are several ways in which you can help out. Here are some of the 
things we need your help on:
<ul>
  <li>Donate source code
</li>
  <li>Donate time writing help
</li>
  <li>Donate time writing demos
</li>
  <li>Donate time fixing bugs
</li>
  <li>Share your experience by helping users in newsgroups and mailing lists</li>
</ul>
<p>JCL accepts donations from developers as long as the source fullfills the 
requirements set up by the JEDI and JCL teams. To read more about these 
requirements, visit the page http://homepages.borland.com/jedi/jcl</p>
<p>You can also donate your time by writing help for the source already 
in JCL. We currently use Doc-o-Matic to create the finished help files but 
the actual help sources are plain text files in a simple to understand format. 
We can provide you with auto-generated templates with all classes, properties, 
types etc already inserted. The "only" thing left to do is fill in the actual 
help text for the help items. If you are interested in writing help, contact us.</p>
<p>If you want to help fix bugs in JCL, go to Mantis and check the bug report 
there. You can post replies as well as fixes directly in the bug report. One of the 
JCL developers will pick up the report/fix and update the CVS repository if the fix is 
satisfactory. If you report and fix a lot of bugs, you might even get developer 
access to CVS so you can update the JCL files directly.</p>
