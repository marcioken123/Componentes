Rebuilding Borland's Decision Cube packages in Delphi 7.
---------------------------------------------------------

When TeeChart Pro is installed in Delphi 7, the Decision
Cube packages are automatically disabled because TeeChart
Pro packages are different to the ones included by 
default in Delphi 7.

With Delphi Enterprise versions, source code files for 
the Decision Cube components are included,
so it's possible to recompile the Decision Cube packages
using TeeChart Pro.

Option 1:
==========

Use the included executable application to automatically
do the recompilation, copy the new packages and install them.

DCubeRecomp.exe

This utility creates backup copies of the modified files,
adding the prefix "BackupOf_" to them.
If you need to revert back to the original Decision Cube
packages, use the backup files (delete the "BackupOf_" prefix).

Destination of backup files are:

-the Decision Cube source folder ( ...\Delphi 7\source\Decision Cube)
-the Windows System folder ( c:\windows\system or c:\winnt\system32)
-the Delphi 7 Lib folder ( ...\Delphi 7\lib)
-the Delphi 7 Bin folder ( ...\Delphi 7\bin)

Option 2:
==========

If the automatic utility DCubeRecomp.exe fails for any reason,
you might want to try recompiling the packages manually.

Instructions to recompile:
---------------------------

1. Download and install TeeChart Pro v5 for Delphi 7.
   (Available at www.steema.com, Customer Downloads)

2. Select "Components->Install packages" in Delphi 7, and remove
   "Borland Decision Cube components" with the "Remove button.

3. Remove *all* Decision cube compiled files. These files are :

   + Delphi 7\Lib directory files:

   mxarrays.dcu, mxbuttons.dcu, mxcommon.dcu, mxConsts.dcu, mxDB.dcu,
   mxdcube.dcu, mxdcube.dfm, mxdsql.dcu, mxdsql.dfm, mxgraph.dcu, mxgrid.dcu, 
   mxpbar.dcu, mxpbar.dfm, mxpivsrc.dcu, mxqedcom.dcu, mxqparse.dcu,
   mxstore.dcu, mxtables.dcu, dss.dcp, mxdconst.dcu, mxdimedt.dcu, 
   mxdssqry.dcu, mxreg.dcu, dcldss.dcp

  + Delphi 7\Bin directory file: dcldss70.bpl

  + WinNT\System32 (or Windows\System) directory file: dss70.bpl

4. Go to Delphi 7 \Lib\ directory and remove dcltee.dcp, teeui.dcp and 
   tee.dcp files.

5. Locate the Decision Cube source code. It should be in the Delphi 7
   \Source\Decision Cube directory.

6. Open the DSS.dpk package and recompile. If you get a complaint about 
   "always built package with the newer built...", then click on "Options" 
   speed button and change: "Build control" to "Rebuild as needed", 
   and recompile.

7. Copy the new DSS70.bpl to Windows \System directory. Copy *all* 
   newly compiled *.dcu, *.dcp, all *.dfm and *.res files to the Delphi 7 
   \Lib directory. 

8. Then open the DclDSS.dpk package. Add DclBDE.dcp to the "Requires" section.
   Change "Build control" to "Rebuild as needed".

9. Open MXReg.pas file and replace (Uses line) ChartReg with TeeChartReg. 
   Save and close MXReg.pas. Recompile DclDss.dpk package.

8. Copy the newly recompiled DclDSS70.bpl to Delphi 7 \Bin directory 
   and *all* newly compiled *.dcu and *.dcp files files to Delphi 7 \Lib directory.

9. Select "Component->Install packages" menu and click the "Add" button.
   Then select the new DclDSS70.bpl package, located in 
   Delphi 7 \Bin directory.
