   TeeChart Pro v6
   Installation Instructions for Delphi 7
============================================================

The automatic installer copies and registers TeeChart Pro
packages, help file for Delphi 7 and installs the TeeChart 
Pro examples and tutorials. No manual intervention should be 
necessary.

If at a later stage you require to manually modify the 
TeeChart installation in Delphi 7, the key installation points 
to note are as follows:

1. Units and packages

- The TeeChart Pro Delphi 7 folder contains all unit 
  files and packages required for the TeeChart 
  installation. No files are copied to any Delphi folders.
  (For use of TeeChart source code, please refer to 
  documentation included with source itself.)

- To provide runtime package support, contents of 
  TeeChart's Delphi7\System folder will be copied to 
  either Windows\System (Win95 or Win98) or WinNT\System32 
  (Windows XP, Windows 2000 or Windows NT 4).

2. Registry/setup file changes

- The path to TeeChart's Delphi7\Lib location is added to 
  Delphi's Library search path.

- TeeChart's helpfiles locations are added to the Windows
  Help location registry.

- TeeChart help filenames are added to Delphi 7's Helpfile 
  Contents index files.

- TeeChart Pro disables previous versions of TeeChart 
  installed in Delphi.

- TeeChart Pro disables Decision Cube as standard Delphi 7 
  Decision Cube packages are not compatible with TeeChart 
  Pro. See the Decision Cube document in this folder for 
  information about how to recompile Decision Cube packages 
  for use with TeeChart Pro.

3. Removed files

- TeeChart Pro installer removes previous TeeChart version files
  from the Delphi folders. If the backup option has been 
  selected in the TeeChart installer, those files will be 
  backed up.

4. Other

- The LPNG.DLL file is copied to \Windows\System (System32)
  folder to enable exporting of TeeCharts to PNG graphic 
  format. This DLL is freely redistributable according to
  the license found at: www.libpng.org

5. Installing manually

- If you wish to install the packages manually under 
  Delphi 7, please do the following:

  a) Check you have the runtime packages copied into 
     \Windows\System (or System32).
     You can find these packages in the System folder in
     this installation.

  b) Start Delphi and select Component->Install Packages.
     Then add the following packages:

      DclTee67.bpl
      DclTeePro67.bpl
      DclTGL67.bpl
      \Windows\System\TeeImage67.bpl

     If you wish QuickReport QRChart support:

      Install the DclTQR67.bpl package and read the 
      install.txt file under QuickReport folder.

     Note: Delphi Standard version does not include 
           QuickReport components.

     Note: If you have Delphi Standard version, please
           install DclTeeStd67.bpl instead of DclTee67.bpl,
           and DCLTeeProStd67.bpl instead of DCLTeePro67.bpl


6. Uninstalling TeeChart Pro

   Please run the standard Windows procedure to remove
   installed applications:

   Control Panel->Add or Remove Programs

   The uninstaller does not remove files that were generated
   after installing TeeChart Pro, like compiled units and
   executables.
   The uninstaller does not remove copies (backup) of files
   originally present in Delphi installation.
   Backup files are preserved into the BACKUP folder.
