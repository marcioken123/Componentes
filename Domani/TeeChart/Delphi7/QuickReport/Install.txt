TeeChart Pro v5 VCL
---------------------

Installing QuickReport TQRChart source code.
============================================

Depending on which QuickReport version you have
installed on your machine, you might need to 
manually recompile a small package for the QRChart
component to use the same QuickReport version you have.

This allows you to install TeeChart Pro with any
past or future QuickReport version with few efforts.


Recompilation is easy.
----------------------

Warning: 

 Check first you have QuickReport installed !

 Visit QuickReport web site at www.qusoft.no for
 upgrades.

 If you have an old TeeChart or TeeChart Pro version, 
 recompilation will fail.  

 Install first the TeeChart Pro v5 packages !
  
 If you are not a Steema customer, download the
 "Free Upgrade Trial" version of TeeChart Pro 5 VCL from
 our web site.

 This upgrade can be found at the "VCL" page, clicking
 on "Trial version Download" link.


Installation Steps:
====================

1) Delete TeeQR.dcp, QRTee.dcu, TeeQRTeeReg.dcu and DCLTQR.dcp files 
   from the Delphi 7\Lib folder. (If they exist).

2) Open Delphi 7.

3) Go to the "Component->Install packages" and remove the DclTQR70.bpl 
   package from the list (the "Remove" button).

4) Next, close all projects. Then go to the "File->Open project" menu
   and pick the the TeeQR57.dpk package.

5) Now click the "Compile" button. The package should compile fine. 
   If you receive errors, see "TroubleShooting" below.

6) Open ("File->Open project" menu) the DclTQR57.dpk package.

7) Now click the "Compile" button. The package should compile fine. 
   If you receive errors, see "TroubleShooting" below.

8) Copy the compiled packages 
   (most probably they were compiled to Delphi 7\Projects\BPL folder):

    - TeeQR57.bpl  to Windows\System (or WinNT\System32).
    - DclTQR57.bpl to Delphi 7\Bin.
    - TeeQR57.dcp  to Delphi 7\Lib.
    - DclTQR57.dcp to Delphi 7\Lib.

    - TeeQR57.dcu, TeeQRTeeReg.dcu and DCLTQR57.dcu to \Delphi 7\Lib.

9) Go to the "Component->Install packages" press the "Add" button and 
   pick the DclTQR57.bpl package (located in Delphi 7\Bin directory,
   if you followed previous steps).
 
   This should install the QRChart component at QReport component palette.

10) Remember to check the "Project->Options->Packages" dialog. 
    The new package name should be listed at the bottom edit-box.

11) IMPORTANT: 

    Don't forget to copy all newly recompiled *.dcu files 
    (from the directory where you keep the files TeeQR.dpk and DclTQR.dpk) 
    to Delphi 7\Lib directory.



---------------------------------------------------------------

TroubleShooting:
----------------

  Most common causes for installation problems are:

   -missing files 

     When Delphi or C++ Builder compile this package, they try
     to find the TeeChart Pro 5 and QuickReport units, either
     in source code (*.pas) or compiled (*.dcu) format.

     Check you have the correct paths to all units at 
     "Environment -> Options" dialogs.

   -wrong files

     If you have the original TeeChart Standard version included
     free in Delphi 7,6,5,4,3 or C++ Builder 6,5,4,3, installation 
     can fail because the original compiled units have preference over
     the new ones.

     Check for existing TeeChart units at \Lib folder and replace
     them with the new ones.
