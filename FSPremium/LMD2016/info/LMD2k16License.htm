<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: 400">You have the non-exclusive right to use this 
product in the Borland/CodeGear development system at design-time only 
by a single person, on a single computer at the same time. You may physically 
transfer the components from one computer to another, provided that the software 
components are used at design-time by a single person, on a single computer at 
the same time. In group projects where multiple persons will use the software 
components at design-time, you must either purchase an individual license for 
each member of the group or contract a site license for your company. A site 
license covers unlimited developers within one company at one location. Use over a 
&quot;local area network&quot; (within the same locale) is permitted provided that the 
software components are used at design-time by a single person, on a single 
computer at the same time (this restriction does not apply for a site license). Use over a &quot;wide area network&quot; (outside the same 
locale) is strictly prohibited under any and all circumstances.</span></font></span></h1>
