2000.05 - Fix grid title painting problem when scrolling grid.  This problem was
          introduced in 2000.04.

2000.04
TwwDBRichEditMSWord
   Addressed comipiling issues when using TwwDBRichEditMSWord in the Delphi 5
   update patch 1 environment.

   Improved performance of searches when using ADOExpress dataset components

TwwLookupDlg, TwwSearchDialog
   Prevented clearing of the embedded incremental search control's text property.  This was
   a problem in some cases, if you set the incremntal search's text property in the
   OnInitDialog event.

   Fixed problem where escape was not closing form (problem was introduced in 2000.03)

TwwDBNavigator
   When using form inheritance with the navigator, it would crash in the ide if you tried
   to delete the ancestor buttons.  Deletion is now automatically prevented to avoid this issue.

   Fixed problem where navigator thought its button was still pressed when the mouse
   was moved over the button.  This problem occurred when an exception was 
   thrown executing the button's functionality.

TwwDBComboDlg
   Published wordwrap property

TwwFilterDialog 
   When using fdByQueryModify, the filterdialog will modify the sql of your dataset. 
   With some tdataset objects that support sql, the dataset may use another property name
   instead of 'SQL'.  In these cases, you can set the new property SQLPropertyName.
   The data type still must be a TStringList.

   Support sql alias names in filterdialog when using FieldsFetchMethod of fmUseTfields

   Fixed exception thrown when the dataset contains a lookupfield.  This would occur if
   FieldsFetchMethod was set to fmUseTfields and a lookupfield existed in the dataset.


TwwDataInspector
   When the inspector was the only control contained by its parent object, the tab
   key would not exit the control. This problem is now fixed.

   OnItemChanged was not fired when exiting inspector.  This event is now fired in this
   case as well.

   When using design time inspector editor, the inspector was not repainted after
   moving an item to a new location.

TwwDBedit
  Did not property display readonly memo fields. This problem is now fixed.

TwwDBGrid
   Fix problem where multiline hints in some cases had the last hint line cutoff. 

TwwDBLookupCombo - Fixed exception thrown with Delphi updatepatch 1 when using ADO datasets
  with this control.

TwwIncrementalSearch - Tab/Escape keys not passed to form.  This problem is fixed.

TwwDBRichEdit - Fixed problem where the print function would print more copies than requested.
   When right-clicking a URL link, the component will not open the url link.  This allows
   pop-up menus to work as expected.
